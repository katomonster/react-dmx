      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <p id="preface"><em>Welcome to our homage to the legendary Oberheim DMX drum machine. While this isn't an exact replica of the original, it is heavily inspired by the original in its look and feel, and it uses the same sounds as the original.</em></p>
        <h2>Programming a Beat</h2>
        <p>Each sound listed on the left is followed by a row of 16 buttons, dividing a "bar" of musical time into 16 "beats". Activating a button will make the sound trigger at that point in time during playback. On playback, a bar plays to the end then loops back to the beginning. The TEMPO value determines how many times the bar will loop in 1 minute.</p>
        <p>For added fun tap the 0 through 9 keys a few times and enjoy making music!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PATTERN: clears or restores the default pattern</li>
            <li>SWING: Introduces timing anomalies during playback to give a more human feel.</li>
            <li>START/STOP: plays or stops the current pattern</li>
            <li>TEMPO (arrow up/down): makes the drum pattern play faster or slower</li>
            <li>NUM KEYS 0-9: Trigger individual drum "hits" for realtime playback fun! Jam along with the running pattern!</li>
        </ul>
